# paper 2 - section 8 paragraph 45
msgid "<p>For over a decade, centralized cloud computing has been considered a standard IT delivery platform. Though cloud computing is ubiquitous, emerging requirements and workloads are beginning to expose its limitations. With its strong data center centric view, where compute and storage resources are relatively plentiful and centralized, little or no thought was ever given to the optimization of the supporting hypervisor and management platform footprint. Few cloud developers seriously considered the requirements needed to support resource-constrained nodes reachable only over unreliable or bandwidth-limited network connections, or thought about the needs of applications that demand very high bandwidth, low latency, or widespread compute capacity across many sites.</p>"
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 8 paragraph 46
msgid "<p>New applications, services, and workloads increasingly demand a different kind of architecture, one that’s built to directly support a distributed infrastructure. New requirements for availability and cloud capability at remote sites are needed to support both today’s requirements (retail data analytics, network services) and tomorrow’s innovations (smart cities, AR/VR). The maturity, robustness, flexibility, and simplicity of cloud now needs to be extended across multiple sites and networks in order to cope with evolving demands.</p>"

# paper 2 - section 8 paragraph 47
msgid "<p>Container technologies like <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/open-source-0\" target=\"_blank\">Docker</a> and <a href=\"https://kubernetes.io\" target=\"_blank\">Kubernetes</a> are becoming the leading standards for building containerized applications. They help free organizations from complexity that limits development agility. Containers, container infrastructure, and container deployment technologies have proven themselves to be very powerful abstractions that can be applied to a number of different use cases. Using something like Kubernetes, an organization can deliver a cloud that solely uses containers for application delivery.</p>"

msgid "<p>Recently companies have begun to apply the simplified administration and flexibility of cloud computing architectures to distributed infrastructures that span across multiple sites and networks. Organizations have an emerging need to take cloud capabilities across WAN networks and into increasingly smaller deployments out at the network edge. Though this approach is in its early days, it is becoming clear that many emerging use cases and scenarios would benefit from distributed architectures.</p>"

msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 9 paragraph 53
msgid "<p>It is worth highlighting that many overlapping and sometimes conflicting definitions of edge computing exist—edge computing means many things to many people. But for our purposes, the most mature view of edge computing is that it is offering application developers and service providers cloud computing capabilities, as well as an IT service environment at the edge of a network.</p>"
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 9 paragraph 54
msgid "<p>The aim is to deliver compute, storage, and bandwidth much closer to data inputs and/or end users. An edge computing environment is characterized by potentially high latency among all the sites and low and unreliable bandwidth—alongside distinctive service delivery and application functionality possibilities that cannot be met with a pool of centralized cloud resources in distant data centers. By moving some or all of the processing functions closer to the end user or data collection point, cloud edge computing can mitigate the effects of widely distributed sites by minimizing the effect of latency on the applications.</p>"
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 9 paragraph 55
msgid "<p>Edge computing first emerged by virtualizing network services over WAN networks, taking a step away from the data center. The initial use cases were driven by a desire to leverage a platform that delivered the flexibility and simple tools that cloud computing users have become accustomed to.</p>"
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 9 paragraph 56
msgid "<p>As new edge computing capabilities emerge, we see a changing paradigm for computing—one that is no longer necessarily bound by the need to build centralized data centers. Instead, for certain applications, cloud edge computing is taking the lessons of virtualization and cloud computing and creating the capability to have potentially thousands of massively distributed nodes that can be applied to diverse use cases, such as industrial IoT or even far-flung monitoring networks for tracking real time water resource usage over thousands, or millions, of locations.</p>"
msgstr ""
# paper 2 - section 9 paragraph 57
msgid "<p>Many proprietary and open source edge computing capabilities already exist without relying on distributed cloud—some vendors refer to this as “device edge.” Components of this approach include elements such as IoT gateways or NFV appliances. But increasingly, applications need the versatility of cloud at the edge, although the tools and architectures needed to build distributed edge infrastructures are still in their infancy. Our view is that the market will continue to demand better capabilities for cloud edge computing.</p>"

Improvements result from:</p>"

"</p>"
"</li>"
"<li>"
"<p>"
"<span>Mitigating bandwidth limits:</span>The ability to move workloads closer to the end users or data collection points reduces the effect of limited bandwidth at a site. This is especially useful if the service on the edge node reduces the need to transmit large amounts of data to the core for processing, as is often the case with IoT and NFV workloads. Data reduction and local processing can be translated into both more responsive applications and reduces the cost of transporting terabytes of data over long distances."
